# so a source hidden only in an arch-specific array is just as real as one in
# the base array, but was previously invisible to every rule that reads
# ctx.sources/ctx.checksums (RCE004, INT002, INT003), regardless of which
# architecture a reviewer's machine happens to be. We don't know CARCH
# statically and don't need to: every arch suffix the PKGBUILD itself
# declares in arch=() is merged in, so nothing hidden behind any of them
# goes unseen.
#
# Suffix candidates are restricted to values actually declared in arch=()
# (not just any array named source_<word>): makepkg itself only ever treats
# source_<arch>/<checksum>_<arch> as a real override when <arch> matches a
# declared architecture, so an unrelated array that happens to be named e.g.
# source_notes or sha256sums_backup is not something makepkg would ever
# consume as source data, and merging it in would inject non-source content
# into ctx.sources/ctx.checksums.
